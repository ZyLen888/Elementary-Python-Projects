# Elementary Python Projects
These are the projects done in Python when I was in my first year of university. 
Most of the projects consist only single file with multiple functions. 
They all achieve different results as outlined in the introduction for each project.

## ✅ FOC Project 1 Biodiversity

Project 1 is all about biodiversity: the variety of different species that exist in a particular habitat. Biodiversity is important because ecosystems with a wider range of species are typically more productive, and have a greater ability to withstand disturbance. A major challenge with biodiversity is how to measure it: we can typically only observe a sample of a large and complex habitat. Birds are considered a good indicator of a healthy ecosystem as they are highly mobile. If they don't like their current surroundings, they will move somewhere else. Even after deciding which species to observe, we still have the problem of working out how to quantify the diversity we observe.

In this project you will write Python functions to explore different questions about biodiversity, in the context of surveying, analysing and predicting the biodiversity of bird species.

## ✅ FOC Project 2 Playing cards with Python

In this project, you will implement a program that plays a game called “Comp10001-huxxy”,1 which is a variant of Rummy and based around multiples of 6, hence the very cheesy name. Why a variant? Because Tim can never help himself ... or more seriously, because Tim wanted to come up with a version that was more compatible with a computational implementation (e.g. not too long, and suitably algorithmically complex, esp. if you get carried away with strategy).

We will play Comp10001-huxxy with two standard packs of 52 cards. Each card has a “suit” (Spades, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds) as well as a “value” (numbers 2 to 10, as well as Jack, Queen, King and Ace). For the purposes of this game, Aces are considered to have value 1, Jacks 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13. The game makes strong use of the notion of the “colour” of a card, where Spades and Clubs are black, and Hearts and Diamonds are red. We will refer to the cards by way of a two-character string, made up of the value ('A234567890JQK', where 'A' refers to an Ace, '0' a 10, 'J' a Jack, 'Q' a Queen, and 'K' a King) and suit ('SHDC',
indicating Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs, respectively). For example, '0C' is the 10 of Clubs, and 'AS' is the Ace of Spades.
